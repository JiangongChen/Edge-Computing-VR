Like the thin-client implementation on the paper [Furion](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3117811.3117815). This is a light-weight application on the client. Most of the work will be finished on the server. 

Run on the Windows system developed by Unity and Android phone developed by Android Studio.
